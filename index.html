    <p class="pioneer">As Jehovah's Witnesses our first and formost interest should be our service to Jehovah God.  We direct our energies wisely when
      we aim for spiritual goals. <span class="bible">(1Co 9:26)</span> Goals help us to make the best use of our time remaining before the end of this system. <span class="bible">(Eph
      5:15, 16)</span> During your family worship, why not set goals for the coming service year? To assist you, this issue of the meeting workbook
      contains articles on several possible goals for you to consider prayerfully. <span class="bible">-Jas 1:5.
    </span>

     <p>
      For example, with the cooperation of everyone in the family, could at least one person become a regular pioneer? 
      If you are unsure of your ability to meet the hour requirement, speak to some pioneers who have circumstances similar to yours. 
      <span class="bible">(Pr 15:22)</span> Perhaps, you can even interview a pioneer during your family worship. Then write out possible schedules. 
      If you pioneered in the past, consider whether your circumstances will permit you to do so now.
     </p>

    <p>
      Could some in your family auxiliary pioneer one or more months? If you have limited energy, you may be able to auxiliary pioneer by spending a little time each day in the ministry. 
      If you have limited time to go in service midweek because you work full-time or are in school, perhaps you can choose a month that has a holiday or five weekends. On a calendar, 
      note when you plan to auxiliary pioneer and write out a schedule. <span class="bible">—Pr 21:5.</span>

What does Sister Aamand’s experience teach us about Jehovah’s loving care of those who make sacrifices to pioneer?
